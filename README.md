Our analysis highlights that budget-friendly meals dominate across platforms, with Takeaway leading in variety. Wallonia shows limited coverage, presenting opportunities for expansion. Major cities like Brussels, Antwerp and Ghent have the highest concentration of top-rated pizza restaurants, with Deliveroo leading. "Kapsalon" outlets are most common in Brussels, Antwerp, and Gent, with Takeaway offering the lowest prices. Takeaway leads in restaurant coverage and deals, followed by Deliveroo and Uber Eats.
